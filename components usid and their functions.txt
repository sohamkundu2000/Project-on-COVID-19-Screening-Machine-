Components used for this project and their Functions
1)	Two make his project I have used two Arduino .
2)	Here Arduino -2  acts as a master and Arduino -1 acts as a slave .Arduino -2 controls the activity of the slave(Arduino-1) via Serial communication.
3)	Temperature measurement part is controlled by Arduino-1 and Sanitizer part is controlled by Arduino-2.
4)	I have also used two LCD for this Project.
  a)	One is for showing temperature .
  b)	Other acts as a Surveillance Monitor. It monitor and display relevant things.
5)	I have used HcSr04 distance measurement sensor to detect whenever a person is in between the range of 10cm to 20 cm in front of the machine.
6)	I have used  TM36 to measure temperature.
7)	At the sanitizer section I have used a servo motor and a LED to represent the sanitizer knob and sanitizer respectively.
8)	I have used a PIR sensor to activate the sanitizer section whenever a hand  will be placed below the knob.
9)	I have used  LEDs and  Buzzer for different purpose.
